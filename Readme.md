## The Mission
I have great colleagues at BeCode. So I made an application where my colleagues can fill in their information (name, email, preferred language) and save it in the database.

For this, I used MEAN stack. MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js) is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications. Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MEAN applications can be written in one language for both server-side and client-side execution environments.


## I learned how to
- Make a server - client structure in the project
- Make a connection using express with the server
- Use node to get the data from the server to a database. 
- Use mongoose dependency for node and mongoDB atlas account
- Make CRUD operations

## Must-have features

- A Friend class on the client with some fields that you find interesting to keep in a friend book
- A Friend schema on the server to make it easy for you to get data from the client to the database and vice versa
- A Friend model to contain your friends data on the server
- Using the mongoose queries, make a CRUD system to create, update, read and delete friends on your database
